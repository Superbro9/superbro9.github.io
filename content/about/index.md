## My website
This is a website I wrote using a static site generator called Hugo which also happens to be my name as well.

## Me
I am Hugo Mason from England who is an app developer for Apple platforms mainly focusing in iOS and watchOS using Swift. Currently I am in year 12 of secondary school studying computer science and IT. I am currently learning how to do web development for a change while I'm a bit bored of programming in Swift and want to learn something else.

## Projects

### WatchTube

I developed an Apple Watch app called WatchTube with a friend I met on Discord, the project was originally open source but unfortunately it was stolen and repackaged multiple times so we made the descion to make the project private. However many parts that contribute to WatchTube is still open source which you can find [here](https://github.com/WatchTubeTeam). It is essentially a YouTube app for the Apple Watch. This project originally started as a joke back in December of 2021 and after about 6 weeks we had the first working prototype app ready. We then submitted it to Testflight so our friends could try the app and slowly over the course of the next few months a few thousand people had accepted the Testflight link to try the app. We then decided to publish it to the App Store and after a bit of back and forth with Apple over copyright as well as YouTube TOS concerns we finally got the app accepted late on June the 8th 2022. The app got many articles and positive reviews on it from prominent people in the tech community including people from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/23342927/apple-watch-ultra-tv-watch), [9To5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2022/06/21/watch-youtube-videos-on-your-apple-watch-with-watchtube/) as well as highly respected youtuber's like MKBHD who [quote tweeted](https://twitter.com/mkbhd/status/1539433813369143296) an article from 9To5Mac with a meme. The app has also been mentioned in youtube videos from [Zollotech](https://youtu.be/gF5fn3V3tpI?t=66), [9To5Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpbqZPQy4sk) as well as others. We reached 1 million downloads on the 4th of January 2023 which is quite an achievement considering the app started as a joke between friends last year.
