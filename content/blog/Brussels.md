##  Introduction

This trip was originally done on 10th of August 2022. I had 10 weeks off school after my GCSE exams and I wanted to see if I could go to another country and back in a day. I had originally planned to go to Paris but after a bit of research I found it wasn't really feasible due to the size of Paris, how far out of the city Gare Du Nord Eurostar station is and the lack of interesting things to do. So I looked at Lille and ran into the same issue of not being able to find much to do so I looked at Brussels. Bruxelles Midi/Zuid station is right in the middle of the city which meant it was easier for transport and I could do more things so thats why I ended up going to Brussels.

## Getting to the Eurostar

I woke up at 4:30am and left the house just before 5:00am to get the 5:30am EMR train down the London arriving shortly before 8am. My Eurostar train was the 9:01 service to Brussels with a stop at Lille so I knew I arrived in plenty of time at London. I was anticipating a huge queue for security and was prepared for an hour's wait but I breezed through in 10 mins probably because of how early I was. Getting through passport control was very easy too with no questions asked... I got through to the other side and into the depature lounge and was surpised to see how busy it all was. Annoyingly there was no spare seats anywhere with plenty of people sat on the floor. I walked over to the station pantry cafe and got some food so I could sit in the cafe seating area as I didn't want to have to stand for an hour. It was painful with all the people brushing past and trying to catch their trains to Amsterdam and Paris.

## Eurostar

20 minutes before the train was due to depart the boarding process started. I quickly pushed my way through to get towards the train was quick as I could to beat the crowd. They forced everyone through two very narrow glass doors and up an escalator which were far too small. I was in coach 11 seat 84 for this outbound trip which was a lot further towards the end of the train then I anticipated. I found the coach and my seat and my first impressions wasn't great because the seat was leaning so far back it felt like I was in a bed, I later found out the seats recline and there is a button on the side of the seat to adjust it, so I had to lean forward for most of the outbound journey which wasn't great. Aside from that, I thought the leg room was plenty big enough and was otherwise very happy with it.  

When we first set off I was very surpised to see how smooth the Eurostar tracks were after having used the UK rail network extensivly and to say it's smooth is an overstatement. After 10 mins we were already speeding through outer London and towards the River Thames to start heading south towards Kent and Dover. Unfortunatly, the wifi and cellular service on the Eurostar is subpar and it really showed during the 20 mins we were under the channel tunnel aka the Chunnel. Eventually we popped out into France and wow the weather was very different from England. Honestly as we rode through France towards Lille it very much felt like a typical UK country side with better weather. An hour and 20 minutes ish after we departed London we pulled into Lille which was definitely a strange station. Looking out the window from my seat it was almost like we were 3 floors undeground as I could see some escalators next to the platform going straight upwards with a bit of the sky peeking down on the platform. After a 10 minute stop in Lille we left again for Brussels where I would be getting off.

## Brussels arrival

When we started to enter the suburbs of central Brussels I was very surprised to see how run down it all was. There were lots of abanonded buildings with graffiti as far as the eye could see and it wasn't a good first impression and I did begin to feel nervous about how the rest of city would be as my research said that the south of Brussels was very nice compared to the north of Brussels. Eventually the train pulled into the station right on time, 2 hours 4 mins after departure at 12:05pm, and because I already had my passport checked and cleared in London I left the station as a domestic passenger. I left the station to try and get a Uber which turned out to be very difficult because the GPS on my phone was awful so it was very difficult for me to know where I was in relation to where the Uber was picking me up.

## Brussels itself

I got an Uber from Bruxelles Midi/Zuid station to the EU Parliamentarium and the traffic on the way was shockingly busy. The Parliamentrium was a self guided tour which I thought was disappointing. They give you a device with headphones and you have to scan the device with these NFC pads which then shows a video with a person explaining something. The videos had no subtitles so I struggled to understand what they were saying as I can't hear very well through headphones when using cochlear implants. I took off the headphones and thought I'd be able to walk around without it fine but that wasn't the case. This women stormed over immediately and told me to put the headphones back on but when I explained that I couldnt hear it she marched me over to the reception and gave me a diffrent device that had British Sign Lanuage support, which I am not fluent so I wouldn't be able to understand it all either, and not wanting to get kicked out I just accepted it and walked around pretending to know British Sign Language. Unfortunatly, a lot of the things they had on display on the tour needed the video description to go along with it otherwise it was all very out of context and as a result of that I finished the tour very quickly, in less than an hour. I visited the shop inside the EU Parliamentarium and it was quite large with some very reasonably priced things but there was a 5 euro duck with an EU badge which I thought was very expensive!

I then headed to Grand Place after getting an Uber from Luxembourg Square which was next door to the EU Parliamentarium. I found Grand Place after watching 'Travel Man 48 hours in: Brussels' and it was described as the "central point" of Brussels. When I got out the Uber I was very surpised to see how busy it all was and it turns out they were getting ready for a flower festival in the square which happens once every 2 years. It was 30°c when I was in Grand Place so I had a sit down in the shade for 15 minutes before I got up and went to find a cafe/restaurant to replace my bottle of water which had gotten warm by now. I went to a cafe and tried to order some orange juice for €2.50 and when I tried to pay using card the woman behind the bar was disgusted that I tried to buy something for so cheap, she even looked at her collegue in horror so I quickly left as to not cause confontation. I went into 3 more cafes/restuaurants and had the same response from all of them. I could only assume there was a minimum card spending fee and I didnt want to pay €5 or however much the fee is for a small drink and I only had 20 euro cash for an unexpected situation so I wasn't inclined to use it so early on in the day so I gave up and started to go shopping down the streets around Grand Place. 

I went into some chocolate shops which gave a nice breath of fresh air from the hot Belgian sun. I bought some chocolate for myself and my family then I went to a waffle shop and got a Bruxelles waffle with chocolate sauce which I think cost me €4.20. I popped into some other tourist shops along the way back to Grand Place and bought a few things. Time was now 15:50 and I had a eurostar train to get at 17:56 back to London. I stopped at Starbucks to get a drink because I was so desperate at this point before going to tourist infomation to ask where to get a taxi and they pointed me to the north west corner but that led to a very pedestrianised area so I couldn't work out how to get an Uber from there. I managed to flag down a taxi and luckily they understood that I wanted to go back to Bruxelles Midi/Zuid station.

## Bruxelles Midi/Zuid station incidents

I arrived back at the train station for the train home except I couldn't find where the Eurostar was. When I walked in a saw a big sign that said 'Channel Terminal' which I immediately thought meant Calais or at least the train to Calais which isn't what I wanted. So I walked around the station for 10 minutes with no luck before I gave up and ask someone in the 'Channel Terminal' area if it was the Eurostar and much to my annoyance & relief they said yes. I walked towards security and put my bag on the conveyor belt to be X-rayed and I was immediately ushered to one side which I was thought was odd so I tried to explain that because of my cochlear implants I can't go through an X-ray machine but they didnt seem to take any notice of that and the next thing I knew was someone telling me about how the pat down process works which was a nice surprise as usually it involves a lot of explaning about why I can't go through an X-ray machine. The pat down went fine and I collected my bag but I was a little suspicious as that was the first time ever I hadn't needed to explain anything about going through an X-ray machine. I then got to EU passport control desk and the person at the desk asked if I had any documents which I thought was odd because my research beforehand said I didn't need any unless I was under 16 (I was 16 years and 11 months old at the time of the trip) and no one in London questioned me once about documents when leaving the country. I said no I didn't have any and the man rolled his eyes and said "Go on". At this point alarm bells were ringing in my head because that is two very strange incidents in a very short time espeicially when I left the UK with no problems at all. I walked past the EU desk and there was two lanes to go through, e-passport gate and a desk that was for British citizens, presuably Brexit related, so I asked the security man where do I go because I wasn't sure and he told me to go through the e-passport gates but I told him I was a British citizen and he said it's fine so I went to the e-passport gate and after a bit of difficulty trying to scan my passport I got through. immediately after going through the gate I was pulled aside by a British border force officer sat behind a tall desk and was immediately asked "Are you travelling alone?" to which I replied "Yes". He then said I should have gone to the other desk for UK citizens but I said the security person told me to come here. The person started to ask me questions like "What time did you get here", "Why were you in Brussels", "What have you done today", "Where do you live", "How are you getting home". He then explained because I'm travelling on my own as a minor he needed to check I wasn't vulernable and everything was ok. They also mentioned that my body language and how I was answering questions made him satisfied that I was ok and he even said "you seem to know what you are doing". The border force officer explained that I needed documents to travel on the Eurostar because I was a minor, despite my research saying I didnt need any and I'm still confused to this day what the exact rules are regarding document and travelling as a minor. I then asked "Why was I let out the country in the first place then?" and they explained that it is the French border control in London and they have diffrent rules to the UK border control. At this point I was very confused about everything especially with the previous two incidents that had happened in the last 10 minutes as well. Eventually, after about 10 mins they let me through to the depature lounge which was packed and I struggled to find anywhere to sit again. It took me about an hour to realise what had happened and how close I was to missing my train especially if the border force officer wasn't happy with what I said when answering his questions.

## Journey home

I managed to board the train home on time and we departed bang on time at 17:56. I was sat in coach 11 again but in seat 15 this time. I went to the onboard cafe known as Cafe Metropole and bought a snack. Eurostar carriage is surprisingly narrow which made it difficult to walk down when carrying things and travelling at high speed while dodging bags and people. The journey home was reletivly trouble free but I had the same issue as on the way out with lack of internet connection and seat being reclined unknowingly.

I got back to London at 18:57, just an hour and 1 minute later because of time difference, and as before we left the Eurostar train as a domestic passenger because we had our passports and security done in Brussels. I had an hour's wait until my 08:02 train home so I walked around St Pancras Station to get food and drinks from M&S before boarding my EMR train home.

I finally arrived back at the train station shortly after 22:00 with my mum waiting to pick me up from the train platform and I finally walked through my front door at about 22:20 after roughly 18 and a half hours after leaving home that morning to do an epic trip to Brussels and back in a day.

## Conclusion

Brussels was awesome. I have already started planning my trip for next summer. Honestly it's one of the best things I've ever done and I wish I had more time to explore other areas such as Ixelles and the royal park of Brussels.
